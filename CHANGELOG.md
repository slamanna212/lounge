For more details, [see the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/compare/v2.3.2...v2.4.0) and [milestone](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/milestone/25?closed=1).

This release improves link and image previews a great deal! On the menu:

- Up to 5 previews are now displayed instead of 1
- All previews on the current channel can now be hidden or displayed using the `/collapse` and `/expand` commands
- Thumbnails can be opened in a fullscreen viewer without leaving the app by clicking on them, and cycled using the previous/next buttons or by hitting <kbd>‚Üê</kbd> and <kbd>‚Üí</kbd>
- Say bye to mixed content warnings: The Lounge can now proxy all images (opt-in option in the server settings) for better privacy
- Title and description are improved overall

Also in this release, auto-complete feature now has an opt-out option in the client settings, and emoji can be searched using fuzzy-matching:

## v2.3.0 - 2017-06-08

For more details, [see the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/compare/v2.2.2...v2.3.0) and [milestone](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/milestone/9?closed=1).

What a release! Our biggest one since the v2.0.0 [release](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/releases/tag/v2.0.0) / [milestone](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/milestone/1?closed=1)!
Expect a lot of new cool stuff, tons of bug fixes and performance improvements.
Thanks to all 16 contributors (!!) who pitched in for this release, open source at its finest!

On the server side, The Lounge now supports an auto-away mechanism, stores channel keys across restarts and key changes, and supports a new SSL CA bundle option in the configuration file.

Users of the client will notice some changes as well:

- A bunch of new hotkeys to style messages (bold, italic, underline, foreground/background color), all listed in the Help window

- A new autocomplete mechanism for emoji, users, channels, commands, and colors:

  <img alt="The Lounge - Auto-completion" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/26863276-a565fad8-4b1f-11e7-8aa4-21bb812c2568.gif" width=500>

  Note that due to the new nick autocomplete, we removed the now unnecessary nick cycle button that was temporarily added in the meantime. Lots of users have reported it had been broken by a previous release anyway.

- Support of page up/down keys to browse the current chat

- Friendliness-bump of time-related tooltips and date marker:

  ![The Lounge - Timestamp tooltips](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/26863323-f57cb85e-4b1f-11e7-9b4c-27b62d518af5.gif) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![The Lounge - Friendly date marker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730/26863322-f577f634-4b1f-11e7-8131-c1b3f3ffe743.gif)

- Improved channel list with `/list`

- Support for `/ban`, `/unban` and `/banlist`

- Fuzzy-matching of the user list search to find folks more easily:

## v2.2.2 - 2017-03-13

For more details, [see the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/compare/v2.2.1...v2.2.2) and [milestone](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/milestone/11?closed=1).

This patch release brings a lot of dependency upgrades and a few fixes. Passing options to the `lounge` CLI (`lounge start --port 8080`, etc.) now works as expected without requiring `--`. We have also disabled ping timeouts for now to hopefully fix automatic reconnection. Finally, upgrading `irc-framework` allows us to fix an extra couple of bugs.

You will now notice a new `(?)` icon at the bottom of the sidebar. It is home of a help center that currently details supported shortcuts and commands. It will be improved over time, but we encourage contributors to help us improve it.

Note that as of this release, `lounge` without any arguments wil display the help information (mirroring `lounge --help`). Prior to this release, it used to start a server, which must now be done explicitly using `lounge start`.

## v2.2.0 - 2017-01-31

For more details, [see the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/compare/v2.1.0...v2.2.0) and [milestone](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/milestone/2?closed=1).

Another long-overdue release for The Lounge!

On the client, it is now possible to generate URLs that pre-fill connection inputs in public mode, a date separator makes it into the chats, `/away` and `/back` commands are now supported, idle time gets displayed on `/whois`.<br>
Also, the client does not abruptly refresh when connection is lost anymore, and user search has been slightly improved. Note however that these last 2 items are still not optimal, but improvements are underway!

On the server, more logging! The `debug` option is now an object instead of a boolean, so make sure to update your configuration file accordingly. More details [here](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/blob/v2.2.0/defaults/config.js#L364-L383).<br>
There are changes revolving around user configuration autoloading: it has been greatly improved and therefore it is now enabled by default. Make sure to remove the `autoload` option from your configuration files.

And of course, tons of fixes and less noticeable feature additions and changes, so make sure to check the full list below!

This is a minor house-keeping release with mostly two sets of changes.

## v2.0.0 - 2016-09-24

[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/compare/v1.5.0...v2.0.0)

After more than 5 months in the works, v2.0.0 is finally happening, and it's shipping with lots of new and enhanced features! üéâ

First of all, the backend IRC library is completely different, which was the first step to deciding on a major release.
This change brings many improvements and fixes, including support for auto-reconnection! This also allows us to easily improve our [IRCv3 compliance](http://ircv3.net/software/clients.html#web-clients).

Main changes on the server include support for WEBIRC, oidentd and LDAP. On the client, users will notice a lot of improvements about reporting unseen activity (notifications, markers, etc.), support for custom highlights, a new loading page, an auto-expanding message input, a theme selector, and more.

Administrators should note that the channel list format in user configuration files has changed. The old format is deprecated, but it will be automatically converted when the server starts (support may or may not be removed later). Additionally, The Lounge now only runs on Node v4 and up.

The above is only a small subset of changes. A more detailed list can be found below.
The following list features the most noticeable changes only, and more details can be found on all [v2.0.0 pre-releases](https://www.github.com/thelounge/lounge/releases).

[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/compare/v2.0.0-pre.7...v2.0.0-rc.1)

Prior to this release, users of Safari 10 were not able to access The Lounge anymore, because of a conscious change the WebKit made to their support of CSP, as [explained here](https://webkit.org/blog/6830/a-refined-content-security-policy/). This release addresses this issue.

Another notable change is the removal of tooltips on mobiles, as hovering states on mobile devices breaks in different kind of ways. Hopefully there will be a better solution in the future, or better support across mobiles.

This is also the first release candidate for v2.0.0. This means only critical bug fixes will be merged before releasing v2.0.0.

[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/compare/v2.0.0-pre.4...v2.0.0-pre.5)

What an exciting release! It's been in the works for more than a month, but the perks are worth the wait.

On the user side, some long-awaited new features can now be found: The Lounge can now track custom highlights, it comes with an auto-expanding text field, and an unread message marker helps keeping track of what happened when you were not watching. A lot of improvements and various bug fixes have been made to the UI.
Note that scrollbar look-and-feel is now delegated to the browser and OS. Use the custom CSS editor and your OS settings to customize them.

Administrators will notice a different format for channels in the user configuration files, and the Docker-related files have been moved to [a dedicated repository](https://github.com/thelounge/docker-lounge). Many bugs have been solved on the server as well.

## v2.0.0-pre.4 - 2016-06-29 [Pre-release]

[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/compare/v2.0.0-pre.3...v2.0.0-pre.4)

This pre-release adds a loading window, helpful on slow connections.
It also implements token persistency, ensuring users do not have to authenticate at every server restart. As a side effect, security is improved by forcing logging out users on all devices when changing their password.

All generated URLs are now HTTP by default, except when explicitly set to HTTPS. For example, `www.example.com` will link to `http://www.example.com`. One needs to share `https://www.example.com` to point others to a HTTPS location.

As a few users have been having issues when running The Lounge with a non-supported Node.js version, we now detect it early to avoid cryptic errors.

This pre-release also adds minor UI improvements, and fixes from the previous version.
While The Lounge still needs a lot of efforts to be fully accessible, this version slightly improves accessibility on clickable nickname.

Internally, we now keep track of our code coverage, which we do not enforce strictly at the moment.

[See the full changelog](https://github.com/thelounge/lounge/compare/v1.4.3...v1.5.0)

With this release, administrators can now define a maximum size for channel history.
While this is not optimal nor the definitive solution, it aims at reducing stability issues where The Lounge would crash after filling up the server's memory.

Other changes noticeable by users include removing custom print styles and preventing sequences of white spaces to collapse into one.
